Four years later — Zuckerberg says Facebook is still “thinking about” adding the oft-requested sdfafd button, Zuckerberg says Facebook is still “thinking about” adding the oft-requested button. At a town hall meeting on Thursday, the CEO revealed he has some reservations about the feature. “There are two things that it can mean,” Zuckerberg said of the potential button, which could be used in a mean spirited way or to express empathy. Finding how to limit it to the latter is the challenge. Zuckerberg said he doesn’t want the button to turn into a “voting mechanism” or something that isn’t “socially valuable.” “Often people will tell us they don’t feel comfortable pressing ‘like,'” Zuckerberg said. “What’s the right way to make it so people can easier express a wide range of emotions?” One suggestion percolating online: Aaron Roll out the feature under a different name. However, an “empathy button” just may not have the same ring to it as “dislike.”";
